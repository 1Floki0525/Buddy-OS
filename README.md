# Buddy-OS

This repo tracks the construction of **Buddy-OS**.

Start here:
- `ABOUT.md` — canonical project anchor/spec for continuity across chats
- `specs/` — formal specs (permissions, UI, build pipeline)
- `scripts/` — reproducible build + tooling scripts

Quick checkpoints:
- Use `scripts/git_checkpoint.sh "message"` to commit (and push if origin is configured).
